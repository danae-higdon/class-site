	<h1>meet Kat and Victoria</h1>
	<p> Meet Kat and Victoria. two impowering female detectives that live in a a large city called Estorrsa which is known for its steampunk/victoria like aesthetic but also for its high crime rate. Kat is very childish and energetic but can also be reckless, but is quick to get defencive if you insult her or her friend. she is a master at stealth and disguise and has many admirers. Some men has asked her to marry them but she always rejects them. shes known for being a heart breaker. Victoria on the other hand who is a little bit older than Kat, is very posh and lady like well trained in table manners and coversations. Despite her well mannered personality, she is a natural when it comes to negotiation and can talk people into doing her bidding, which i guess make her shlightly manipulative. Kat and victoria are the only female detectives and they must work together as a team to prove they are more than just pretty faces. And despite the fact that they are total opposites and that they get on eachothers nerves, they are like sisters.</p>
